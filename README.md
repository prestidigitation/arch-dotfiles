# arch-dotfiles

Dot files for Arch Linux, based off of [spilledmilk's](https://github.com/spilledmilk/arch-dotfiles) efforts.

zsh requires there to be a .zshenv file in $HOME, where the config directory can be set like so:
```zsh
ZDOTDIR="$HOME/arch-dotfiles"
```
Currently, I have .zsh_history configured to be stored in `$HOME`.
